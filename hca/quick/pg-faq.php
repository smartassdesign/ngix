Program duration is the only differentiator between programs. The full-time programs are about 5.5 months long, and the part-time programs are about 11.5 months long, depending on your start date.

As NGIHCA is too small to be part of the Federal Financial Aid programs (TITLE IV/FAFSA), we strive to find ways to make our programs more financially accessible to students whenever possible. Part-time program schedules allow us to recognize cost-savings that we pass along to students in order to make the program more financially accessible.<?php echo do_shortcode('[/collapse]')?>

Tuition includes all books, materials, uniforms and 30+ piece professional knife and pastry set made by Mercer. It also includes career services, lifetime access to our alumni-only job board, and inclusion in our 2500+ worldwide alumni community.<?php echo do_shortcode('[/collapse]')?>
