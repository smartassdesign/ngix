		<h4>Our Mission</h4>
		<p class="lede">Natural Gourmet Institute provides exceptional, innovative and interdisciplinary health-supportive culinary education. Rooted in Dr. Annemarie Colbin’s seven criteria for food selection, our curriculum empowers chefs, individuals and communities to be leaders in the conversation about food and wellbeing through the preparation of healthful and delicious meals. By making mindful and deliberate decisions about the ingredients we source, we are able to advocate and utilize a sustainable food system that respects the earth’s natural resources and the people who make each meal possible.</p>
